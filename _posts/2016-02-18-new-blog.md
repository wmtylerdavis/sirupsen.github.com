 I decided to take my website in a new direction and will now focus more on my extracurricular activities instead of focus on my work, which I get enough of at work. 

 This site will be directed at me finally finishing my first novel, which I've attempted several times in the past, mostly through NaNoWriMo. I usually taper out at about the 100 or so page mark.

 My current effort is going better. I'm writing on paper instead of on a Word doc. I focus on the next page and not re-writing what I wrote the day before. Sometimes I find problems, things I need to add or remove from what's been written before. I go with it. I make a note to change those things and I continue on like it's been done.
