Maybe you're like me - you believe that you can tell more about someone by their music preferences than their job, their car, or even their Starbucks order (caramel latte with two pumps of toffee nut please). Music played a tremendous role in my life between marching band in high school and playing guitar in cover bands throughout college. Almost every paycheck from my after school jobs went to buying CDs. With all this devotion to music, why do I find myself skipping through my workout playlist every morning I run?

###1. The Workout Playlist Pool
In order to mitigate this dilemma, I no longer have a workout playlist - I have two. The first I call the workout pool, which is constantly being added to as I find new songs I feel will pump me up for running or lifting.
###2. The Simple Playlist
The second list is the actual workout playlist for that particular day or workout. I start by gauging how long my run will be and then aim to make a playlist in that same amount of time. I take songs from the pool and throw them into this playlist until I've reached that time, making sure not to add any fluff as that would increase the likelihood of skipping songs. For a 20 minute run this may be as little as 5 songs, but they are the right 5 songs, hand chosen for this workout.

###Footnote
I've seen a lot of hype lately for workout music being in a certain bpm (beats per minute) range of 120-130. That's great if it works for you, but I personally follow [Crossfit Endurance](http://crossfitendurance.com/) and follow Brian Mackenzieâ€™s recommended 180 to 190 foot falls per minute. Finding songs with those sick beats would be insane, so I actually tend to listen to music between 90 to 95 bpm and have my left foot land on the beat.
