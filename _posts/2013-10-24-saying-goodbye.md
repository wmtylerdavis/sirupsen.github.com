 My military career is just about finished. I've had a blast over the six years: TDYs to Las Vegas, Hawaii, and St. Louis come to mind - yes St. Louis where I got to sit right behind the dugout at a Cards game... oh and there was this whole night where I was bored at a hotel and talking to a girl I knew who was also bored and stuck in a hotel in Dallas - I don't know where I'd be had that never happened.
 
A lot of people outside the Air Force tend to understand why I'd be eager to get out, while everyone in the Air Force can't believe I'd leave a career with a guaranteed retirement paycheck. It's amazing how from the outside it can look noble defending your country but from the inside it can feel so cushy. Honestly, I just want to be in a job where I'm happy to work every day, and the Air Force just is no longer that for me. While I did have jobs that I loved and I'm sure I would have them again. Without the guarantee of having that straight for the next 14 years, I just couldn't commit to this life any longer.
 
Things I won't miss:

1.  Internet Explorer 8

2.  Mutiple things about Excel

  - VLOOKUP
  - COUNTIF
  - text versus numbers, numbers vs text, there's nothing like writing these if statements:
   
        if (A2*1 >= 48.0, ... ) or if (A2 = "4", ...)

  - did I mention VLOOKUP?

3. Moving jobs every couple of years, moving locations every 3 or 4, leaving friends.

4. The uniforms, the haircuts, shaving daily.
 
Things I will miss:

1. Getting to know new people. The people have definitely made the Air Force great. There was always folks to hang out with, always a lunch crowd to tag along with, and there are a few people that I will be lifelong friends with.

2. The old timers, who tell you stories from Vietnam, the Cold War era, etc... Always entertaining.
 
There is probably a ton of things that I will miss and more that I won't miss, but I think that should do it for now. I'm about a month away and the excitement mixed with the terrorizing agony of starting anew has reached a whole new high. My wife and I are excited. The prospects for the future are looking bright right now. More info to come.
