I finally finished Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial (and it feels so good).
 
Honestly, I have a life. I have a wife and a baby that started walking a few weeks ago. My wife and I get like no sleep. So I'm happy that I took the tutorial pretty slowly and let a lot of things sink in. I finished it on Saturday and then I played around on Sunday with a mailer and delayed_job.
 
### Next Steps
 
1.  This is going to sound stupid, but my next step is to basically work through the tutorial again, hitting some key points that I really want to sink in further. This time I will be working on my own app entitled [Lunch Push](http://lunchpush.com).
 
2.  Read the pickaxe book. Learning a framework is great, but learning the language is key. Luckily Ruby is a far far better language to learn than any other I've came across. From the little bit I have picked up I can say that. It's fun, easy to read, easy to understand. Plus it's different enough from other languages to make it intellectually stimulating. I remember trying to "learn" java from my C++ academic background. Java was just too similar. In fact, it simplified the hard things in C++ but kept almost all the rest. I got bored and ultimately declared "I know all I want to know about java."
 
3.  Lastly, I will probably read some other Rails books. All the while, I should be adding features to Lunch Push. I plan to eventually create an API for it so that I can make a simple iPhone application. This will also help me port by BDD/TDD skills to iOS. Starting fresh on a new project and testing (with [Cedar](http://github.com/pivotal/cedar) ) before code is written sounds a whole lot better than testing after I have a functioning app.
