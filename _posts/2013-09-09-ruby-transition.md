Building views and controllers is pretty fast once your model is finished. I'm able to get an app up a running with minor HTML skills and a little CSS or Sass mixin.
 
2.  The community is amazeballs. Seriously, I can't get over this. I go to several meetups in the area: NOVA and DC. I watch [the Ruby Hangout](www.therubyhangout.com) and I have watched a ton of rubyconf videos. There is a wealth of online resources that you are only going to get with an open source community.
 
3.  Ruby plays nicely with git. This is just a minor pet peeve I have with iOS and Xcode. Pods and nibs do not play well with git. I've spent more time merging and rebasing than any experienced Ruby programmer - I guarantee that.
 
4.  Ruby simplifies the hard stuff or rather it simplifies the monotonous stuff that you'd be spending time on with other frameworks. I remember when I first played around with PHP maybe 8 or 9 years ago and even more recently like 4 years ago. It took longer to configure everything than it did to write the code.
