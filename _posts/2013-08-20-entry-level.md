I'm always afraid of divulging too much information on here, plus a lot of people tend to find this fact a little funny. I'm currently going to school part-time for another undergraduate degree in Computer Science (shhh... don't tell anyone). The beginning of each new semester I'm always confronted with this notion that maybe this is a waste of money and time.

In my current job search it seems like I could be correct - except I don't have a job yet so keeping the option of using my GI Bill next semester is still a possibility. My math degree seems to do me well, that and the little experience I do have in software development. I'm able to apply and interview for a number of entry level jobs, which is all I can expect given my background.

Things I've learned:

1. Your degree doesn't matter as much as your knowledge.

	Current CS programs tend to focus a little too much on compiled languages and not on the web. If you want a job with the web, then by all means learn web development!

2. Contribute to Open Source - sort of

	Being a green software developer it is hard to find an open source project to work on. I've tried my best to find something interesting to work on, but the real fact is it's hard to contribute to anything you don't use. You are not going to contribute to Rails without being a Rails developer first. You aren't going to contribute to Firefox without developing plugins first.

	Your first contributions to open source should be small simple projects that you work on yourself or on a small team with friends. They can be something just for you, but just putting your code out there is good enough to get hired at a lot of companies.

3. Interview like you don't need the job.

	This is just something I've come to figure out. I get nervous. I come off as desperate when I am not. Just be yourself and be honest if you don't know the answer to a question. Some interviewers get off on knowing more than the interviewee, some ask the most random questions - I've even had questions that I just had to respond "You know there's a whole book on that subject right?". Don't sweat it and you're better off.
