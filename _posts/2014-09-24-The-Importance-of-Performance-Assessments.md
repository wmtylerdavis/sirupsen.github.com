It's pretty well established that [athletes train](http://www.outsideonline.com/fitness/bodywork/the-fit-list/Athletes-Dont-Exercise-They-Train.html). Most runners likely have a goal in mind, whether it's to lose weight, be active, or live longer. Maybe they run to get away with eating more calories. Regardless, going out to run just to run is not going to result in anything consistent. It won't stick or you plateau in weight loss.

It helps to have a plan, and maybe it stems from a degree in mathematics but I find another amazing motivator is keeping statistics. Waiting for race day to attempt a new PR is a recipe for disaster, I believe one of the most important aspects to any training plan, and often overlooked, is the fitness assessment - a workout that can be done monthly to assess if your training is working. If not, you may want to tweak something.  

My personal fitness assessment, I've been doing since college, is a combination of endurance and high intensity. I run at a slow pace for about two miles. Then I take a little breather, stretch, and run a mile on a marked course for time. Finishing up with an easy pace run home. The mile is the real assessment, but I feel like the warm-up and cool down are engrained facets to this workout. At my fastest I was able to do the mile in a little under six minutes, and with every assessment I hope to inch back closer to that time. 

There is no one-size-fits-all assessment. Us age groupers are out there competing against old PRs, not each other - no matter what our wives think. Your sport and variation in race distance matter so customize the assessment to your needs, but I wouldn't make it your race distance, somewhere between a quarter to half the distance should suffice.
