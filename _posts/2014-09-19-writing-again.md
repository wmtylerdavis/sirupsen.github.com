My favorite magazine, in fact the only magazine I have a subscription to is Outside, and one of my favorite issues is the Top Places to Work issue. Since entering the civilian workforce almost a year ago I've learned a lot about how companies operate and why articles like the Top Places to Work shouldn't have a lot of weight in your career decisions. 

If you're unfamiliar with Top Places to Work, I'll try to catch you up. They usually start out with some sort of criteria. Outside has four key factors to go over, and I'm of the opinion that almost any worthwhile company could satisfy each category and make their list. 

1.  Fitness Plans
This sounds like an incredible perk, but tons of companies can qualify. Whether they have a few machines in their office building, one tredmill desk (don't get me started) or offer small discounts at local gyms. Coming from the military where workout time fit into your 40 hour work week and the gyms had everything from a Crossfit style box to a Pumping Iron style Golds Gym clone, often in the same facility, not really any company can compare. 

2.  Vacation
3.  Flex-time Policies
4.  Office Culture
