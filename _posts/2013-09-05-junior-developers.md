I've noticed a big trend that is baffling. Entry and junior developer jobs requiring not only 1 to 3 years of experience but 1 to 3 years of experience in very specific environments.
 
### Junior Ruby on Rails Developer
-  1 to 3 years experience with Ruby on Rails
-  experience with MongoDB, Redis, Puppet
-  thorough knowledge of jQuery
-  BDD/TDD with Rspec, Cucumber, etc...
 
So let me get this straight. You are basically asking for someone who can immediately sit in the position and start contributing but you expect to pay them a junior salary. So really this is just a job advertisement for someone with low self esteem.
 
More power to the guys applying to these jobs and doing badass salary negotiation. However if you aren't doing badass salary negotiation then you're doing people like me a disservice. You see I have a bachelors degree and pretty great knowledge of data structures and algorithms. I have worked in a professional environment for 6 years. I've coded professionally in iOS with a Rails backend, but breaking into a Rails job seems about impossible when the definition of junior and entry level has changed to this BS.
