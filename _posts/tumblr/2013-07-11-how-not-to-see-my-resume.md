Caveat: My resume is available for anyone to see here on the site.

I’m on the job hunt, but as I’m not available for a few months I’ve narrowed my focus to only great companies and no startups. Startups tend to need someone like yesterday, so telling them to wait to December doesn’t usually go over well.

What is a great company? Well I can tell you what it’s not. It’s not a company that touts its jeans on Friday policy or brags about its coffee and snack bar. If in your job posting you ask for a ninja, wizard, or any other character better suited for a Kung Fu movie, then your company is crap and I’m not sending you my resume. Also if you feel the need to mention nerf darts. The last time I played with nerf guns I was like 9; I prefer to keep it that way. This is like the direct opposite of having a kegerator in your office.

Great companies have a mission greater than their handful of employees. Great companies have employees that want to be there. Great companies don’t worry about hours; they just know the job will get done. Great companies probably have a kegerator.

P.S. PHP ninjas?? Really?? This isn’t the 90’s.
