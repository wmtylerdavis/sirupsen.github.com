I geeked out last night by going to my first Meetup ever. This was a DCRUG (Ruby Users Group) meetup. This month’s was set up for newbs, which I’m proud to say I was more like an advanced newb.

I’ve learned a lot about Rails and Ruby from ruby.railstutorial.org, plus it helps knowing a couple different programming languages and having a pretty great understanding of MVC from my iOS development. There were a few people who didn’t know a programming language at all.

We went through a Ruby tutorial, then a Rails tutorial (the usual create a blog with scaffolding),  pizza and soda were provided. All in all it was a great experience.
