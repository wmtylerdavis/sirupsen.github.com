I have to say that I did nothing this past weekend, except adding some minor tests to the Michael Hartl tutorial app. It felt so good. Why you ask did I take a break from my love of all thing code?

The first part of Breaking Bad season 5 was added to Netflix. Jenn and I were pretty obsessed with it for a couple weeks some months back. It is so good and let me say that the first half of this season didn’t disappoint either. We can’t wait for the new episodes starting this weekend!

So my buddies are working on a new app, you can find more able tikr [here](http://tikr.me). Also be sure to download the free iPhone app.
