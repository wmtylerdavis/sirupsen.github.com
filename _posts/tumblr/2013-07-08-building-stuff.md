I wasted about 2 hours on a programming challenge from Facebook tonight. Not exactly sure why I even bothered. It’s not that I’m not adept at Data Structures and Algorithms. I’m okay. Given time I do more than fine. I just hate the pressure and often find myself puzzled for a good while in these competition type things.

I know being on the job hunt I’m sort of forced to get my head around these puzzles. So I’m probably going to start spending a few hours a week devoted to them.

Challenges and puzzles are beneficial and all but I believe it’s way better to build something. Now that HowWeMet is in a pretty stable version in the App Store, I have an Open Source SDK that I’m planning to work on to both learn Rails and help my GitHub resume. I’ll also be looking to fork something interesting and see if I can contribute.

Back to the grind…
