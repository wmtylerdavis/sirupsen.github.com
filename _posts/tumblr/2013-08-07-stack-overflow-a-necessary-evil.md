I’ll start by saying that I’m not a fan of Stack Overflow at all. The user experience is one of the worst that I’m a part of. Questions get voted down or marked as duplicate when they shouldn’t be by users with more power. Sometimes you answer a question and it is never marked as the best answer or maybe the question doesn’t gain enough traction for you to get any up-votes. Overall I’ve given up both asking questions and answering them.

I use Stack Overflow for a number of reasons though. One is that its job board is one of the best by far and I was invited to build a Careers 2.0 profile. The second reason is it is still the best way to find an answer to a programming question. But wait, Tyler, you said you don’t ask questions on there???

No, I’ve become what I call a Stack Overflow Miner. I find that all questions that aren’t super specific have been answered, of course we all know this because if we ask a basic question it gets marked as a duplicate. And of course if you ask a specific question it gets marked as too specific.

So really the key is to know how to find the information you are after. Couple of strategies here:

1. The more basic the better, know what language you want your answer in. Let’s say I want to know how to reverse a linked list. First you can search by the language: “reverse linked list ruby”
2. It’s been answered in Java. Java is the most readable language in my opinion. If you can’t find the answer in the language you are looking for, then try in java: “reverse linked list java” will almost definitely come up with an answer.
3. Bare bones your error. When looking up errors or warnings never leave in the pointer information or any app specific information. Strip it to the bare bones of the error message and its almost guaranteed to be found.
4. Lastly, this is just a pet peeve of mine, but never copy and paste. Not only will typing it out help you get a better understanding of what’s going on, but answers are notorious for bad variable names. Always create your own.
