Applying for jobs is nerve-racking. It’s a job unto itself. I find myself terrified to open email yet I feel the urge that I must every 5 minutes.

It baffles me that some companies don’t feel the need to send out a kind thanks for applying but it wasn’t a fit email. In this day of automated everything, I get these type emails almost daily. While I don’t know why some companies are interested in me while others are not, I feel that at least these emails serve a purpose. Some recruiters have even taken the time to write an email to me, often going with the cliché “it’s not you, it’s me (our company)” but still I find these emails helpful and kind.

It also amazes me how fast some companies are at responding to resumes. Goodreads seems to have it down pat, you can pretty much expect some kind of response the same day you apply, which probably means they are using some automated system to scan your resume for keywords.

Anyway, got to run and check my email.
