So, in my job search I’m reaching out mostly to a range of top 20 companies, companies everyone has heard of, and I’m reserving remote job openings for a few months from now. This is because there aren’t a ton of iOS remote jobs and there are more Rails remote gigs. I’m in the beginnings of learning Rails, so probably not the time to apply.

What I’ve noticed applying for these big companies (Twitter, Facebook, Zappos, GitHub, etc) is that I’m a passive user. I love Twitter but I hardly tweet. I don’t have the followers to get my word out (not that I have many on tumblr either). So instead I favorite tweets, I retweet, and on occassion I reply to tweets. Same thing goes for most other services. I applied at Goodreads and realized I just read reviews. I never write them myself. I always have a hard time jumping in on projects on GitHub but man I love GitHub and it has been an immense asset in the private iOS repos that both I and the startup I work for have.

I guess what I’m getting at is it’s hard to prove you love a product when you don’t use it as its intended. But I can assure you if I’m even somewhat active then I like your product. A great example of something I never use is Untappd. Trust me I drink beer. I love craft beer and pride myself on trying anything I haven’t before. Yet I find it hard to log in to Untappd and rate beers. It’s just not something I care enough to use.
