title: What I'm Looking For

First and foremost I’m looking for a job. I would love for it to be with iOS, however I’m learning Rails and finding it to be extremely fun and Ruby is a great language to get along with. Rails is probably more fun than iOS. Part of this may be due to Test Driven Development, which I could/should use with iOS but I haven’t done much of in the past. I’m going to try to do more in the future for sure.

All that being said, I can’t limit my job search. I have to put food on the table. I have a wonderful baby girl and a wife who would prefer to stay at home with her ( I would too, remote jobs are awesome). What I want in a in house position is for me to want to be there every day. I want it to be doing something I enjoy. I don’t want to wear a suit or a uniform but role up in my favorite pair of jeans and a Star Wars t-shirt. I don’t care about nerf gun wars. I actually read a posting with a mandatory happy hour on Friday afternoons. I love beer more than most people, but don’t cut in on my family time on purpose. 

Oh and USA soccer killed it today. Way to go fellas.
