title: "Thinking About the Future"

The past month or so has been insane. I went with the family to Disney and had a great time. I've been out processing the Air Force and that has been draining, frustrating, and filled me with anxiety. That being said Jenn and I have a couple perspective opportunities, so the future is looking bright.
 
I've had some great conversations over the past couple of months. I'm often asked about the future and about what I'm looking for in a job. I find my answers are tough to articulate.
 
I want happiness, but what does that mean? Well for the past 6 years I haven't been doing enough of what I enjoy. I enjoy programming because I love the pursuit of a solution. I love the feeling of relief and joy that comes when a solution is found. That's part of why I was a math major in college rather than history. There's no relief when you get done writing a 10 page paper, because in a way it could always be reworked. There is a ton of relief when you get an answer, look it up in the back of the book, and know that you found a way to get to the right solution. Software development makes me feel happy, this is especially true when using TDD or BDD. I'm creating a problem for myself and then I'm solving it.
 
Happiness in my career is one thing, but I've spent a lot of time over the past year or so working on software in my free time. I can't wait for that to be my 8 hours a day. I want to spend my free time being me, spending time with my wonderful family, playing guitar again, playing soccer, and finding new hobbies to enjoy with Jenn and Addie. That my friends is happiness.
 
For the future, I'm a little unsure. I have the GI Bill that I may spend on a masters in Computer Science but it may be an MBA. I feel like I'm not ready to commit on the future just yet. I have some leadership chops, but I may be equally happy to spend the rest of my career buried in code.
