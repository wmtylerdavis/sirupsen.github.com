I wasn't exactly happy with tumblr, so I went looking for alternatives to nothing really. Then I came across this [blog post](http://sirupsen.com/what-I-wish-a-ruby-programmer-had-told-me-one-year-ago/) and noticed that it was powered by GitHub pages and Jekyll. I knew about GitHub pages but sort of thought they were relegated to repo descriptions and creating your own themes. 

So I forked the @sirupsen blog and renamed it. Then I was off to the races. You can learn more about [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), which has been a dream to work with. Most of my pages and all of my blog posts are written using [Kramdown](http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/) flavored [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Leaving me with only a little HTML and very slight bit of CSS work to do.
