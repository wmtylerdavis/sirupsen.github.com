Why are all developer journeys so similar? I rarely hear one akin to my own.
 
###Example: 
When/How did you start programming?

###Answer: 
I started programming at age 8 on an Apple II where I developed video games.

###Alternate answer: 
I started developing websites about video games on my parent's IBM PC in the late 90s.
 
Seriously the first time I saw HTML I was like eff this. I built a website on angelfire because it was easy. In high school I liked girls. I only showed a moderate interest in computers. My parents owned one PC and it was shared between them, my sister, my step-brother, and myself. So the few hours I got on that machine were spent on AIM. 
 
In college I took Intro to C because it was required for math majors. It was only at that point that I started to show some interest, but then I went to parties and drank beer and forgot to care. I also took some C++, Data Structures, and learned a bit more about compiled languages. The web was still this alien thing that wasn't taught. You learn web by doing.
 
Along came the iPhone and I thought this shit is awesome. Obj-C was similar enough to C++ that I could get my hands dirty with it. There was also these wonderful inventions that are Google and Stack Overflow. In college I think I searched via Yahoo! maybe??

Then there is Rails. I've learned more about web in the past couple months than I ever thought was possible. Those CS fundamentals still play a key role in my development, but I'm just amazed with this community.
