    <h2>Budding children's book narrator. Opportunist writer.</h2>
    <p>
    <p>Tyler writes software for <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/">the Washington Post</a>. He lives in Florida, close but not too close to the beach. He thinks the best job in the world is reading to his children, but finds it difficult to pay grocery stores with hugs and smiles.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, when there are a few extra minutes in the day, he works on his first novel. Sometimes, when there are even more minutes - not as often, he writes about writing, reading, and even sometimes about writing software.
    </p>
    <p>He loves soccer. His favorite team is Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
