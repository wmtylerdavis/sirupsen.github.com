    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
    <p>I'm a software developer currently living in Dallas. A mid-pack runner and two-time Half Ironman finisher, I like to write about food, running, and maybe the occasional trip to the zoo.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I'm a family man with a beautiful wife Jenn <img src="/static/images/us.jpg" alt="Jenn"> and the greatest little girl ever<img src="/static/images/Niagara.jpg" alt="AZD">
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I love soccer - I follow the USMNT and Tottenham Hotspur. I'm an avid reader of <a href="http://www.outsideonline.com/">Outside Magazine</a>. I climb at <a href="http://summitgyms.com/">Summit Gyms</a> on some of my lunch breaks, and you can find me on the mountain bike trails on the weekend.</p>
