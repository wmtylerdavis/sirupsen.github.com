    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm a software developer currently living in DC as I finish out my stint in the US Air Force. I'm currently seeking employment for December to January.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I like to code iOS but I've recently fallen in love with Rails and the Ruby programming language. I've also been known to throw down some C++ and a little Java, but I am by no means a polyglot. I stumble my way to elegant solutions. I have a vague recollection of data structures. I believe any language can be learned quickly with a solid basis of CS fundamentals and a decent understanding of how to type things into the Google search engine.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I'm also a family man with a beautiful wife Jenn <img src="/static/images/us.jpg" alt="Jenn"> and the greatest little girl ever<img src="/static/images/Niagara.jpg" alt="AZD">
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I'm a huge fan of soccer, following the USMNT and Tottenham Hotspur, playing pickup when I can.</p>
